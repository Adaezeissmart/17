        <H2>My first hobbie:</H2>
        <p>I grew up loving art and It was what I was good at! As time went on I grew to love it and thus made it my first ever 
            hobbie I learnt and to this day I am still getting better and better and better and now I want to be and architect

    <div class="Container-fluid border 100px black"><H1>Sporty me</H1>
    <p>As from six I went to England and fell in love with football and It became my second hobbie making me fit and fast making me very agile. This led to me being a great player but even though I am agile I am a defender(right back) but here and then I still run up with the ball to deliver a cross</p>
